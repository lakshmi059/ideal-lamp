A simple to-do list application is a program that allows users to manage and keep track of tasks or activities they need to accomplish. The application typically provides functionalities such as adding tasks, displaying the list of tasks, and possibly deleting tasks.

 
 how does this  application works:

Adding Tasks:
Users can input task descriptions into the application.

Displaying Tasks:
The application displays the list of tasks, including any additional details.
Users can view their entire to-do list at a glance.

Deleting Tasks:
Users can remove tasks that are no longer relevant or needed.
This feature helps to keep the to-do list clean and focused.

if needed we can make changes in this so that additional features can be added.
